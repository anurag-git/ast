# Arithmetic expression evaluator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmaureir/ast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmaureir/ast)

## Requirements

> Create a C++ program that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions.
> Parsing and evaluating should be two independent steps that are separated by a data structure (the AST).
>
> The program should not use anything apart from the C++11 STL.
>
> Arithmetic expressions consist of decimal numbers combined using the binary
> operators +, *, /, - and parentheses and should respect the usual precedence relations.
>
> The program should detect invalid input and report an appropriate error.
>
> Unit tests are appreciated.
>
> Example:
>
> On input `(4 + 5 * (7 - 3)) - 2`, the program should output `22`

## Structure

The code is written in two steps:
1. [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm):
   * The parsing process will create a string in [Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation),
    but also will populate an implementation of an [Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
    using a stack.
2. Postfix Evaluation:
   * There are two methods to evaluate a RPN or an AST.

* Supported operations
   * Only `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` are supported, but it can be easily expanded.
* Supported numbers:
   * All the number are interpreted as `float`.
   * The format could be `1.2`, `99`, `101.`, etc.
   * The notation `.3` is not supported. The reason for this was that C++11 [regex](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex)
     does not support *Negative Lookbehind*.
     If `boost` was allowed, one can easily replace the notation with:
     `/(?<!\d)[.](\d)")/0.\1/`.

## Compilation and execution

To compile the code, a `make` is enough.
The execution will look like:

```
$ ./arithmetic
(4 + 5 * (7 - 3)) - 2
22
```

The test can be compiled with `make test`.
The current code is using [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)
as test framework.

```
% ./test
===============================================================================
All tests passed (44 assertions in 3 test cases)
```
